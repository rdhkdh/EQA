It has been the endeavour of the ECI that the level playing field for all stake holders, including candidates and political parties is not disturbed and the electoral process is not allowed to be vitiated by any means including misuse of money power. The Election Commission vowed to respond to the emerging challenges in overall election management, faced with increasing threat from those who were hell bent on distorting the mandate of the electors and as such adopted a structured mechanism to facilitate and monitor election expenditure starting with the elections to the Legislative Assembly of Bihar held in 2010. While curbing the menace of money and muscle power, ECI ensures that general public does not face any inconvenience. In fact, all out efforts are made to ensure that the common man on the ground is sensitized to become a stakeholder in aiding and assisting the ECI mechanism in combating the menace of bribery of voters and other corrupt practices, polluting the electoral system.
